## Supabase Pivot (v1.5.0)

**What changed:** Replaced the planned access-code-gate + in-memory state with full Supabase integration.

**Why:**

- Auth (email/password + magic link) is production-grade and free — building from scratch would take hours and be less secure
- PostgreSQL with RLS gives per-user data isolation out of the box
- Storage bucket handles PDF uploads with per-user access policies
- Rate limits survive server restarts (durable DB-backed)
- $0/month on free tier — no cost increase

**Architecture:**

```
Frontend (Vercel) → Supabase (auth/db/storage) → FastAPI on Railway (compute) → Supabase (persist results)
```

**Impact on agents:**

- **N** scope changed: access-code-gate → wire upload to `/api/analyze` with JWT + wire `/api/history`
- **O** scope changed: add Vercel deploy for frontend, Railway for backend (Dockerfile needed)
- **P** unchanged

## Work Queue

1. ~~Alpha through Oscar~~ **All merged** (A–P, 16 agents/skills)
2. Delta (independent R&D, low priority)
3. 🚀 **Ready to deploy** — see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Known Issues

- ~~**PII SSN detection gap**~~ **FIXED**
- **Presidio email detection** may fail in 28K+ char text
- **Flaky test_api tests** — 9 tests in `test_api.py` fail in batch (env var state leaking). Pass individually.

## Last Session

- **Date:** 2026-03-09
- **Session:** /done — merge Agents N + O
- **Completed:**
  - Agent N merged (Frontend Wiring) — upload, history, pipeline wired to real API
  - Agent O merged (Deployment) — Dockerfile, Railway, Vercel, env configs, DEPLOYMENT.md
  - All deployment workstreams complete — ready to deploy to Railway + Vercel
- **Next:** Deploy to production! See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
